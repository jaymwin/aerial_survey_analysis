# aerial_survey_analysis
Data, analysis, and automated reporting for the Wisconsin Waterfowl Breeding Population Survey

## Things to do

1. Clean up code/code annotation
2. Write survey analysis instructions
3. Change to OC fonts (?)
~~4. Fix long-term averages (some or all might use all years; should be all except current year)~~

## Notes

- For whatever reason, the report will render on my Desktop but not when the project is run from the OAS drive...
