# aerial_survey_analysis
Data, analysis, and automated reporting for the Wisconsin Waterfowl Breeding Population Survey

## Things to do

1. Clean up code/code annotation
2. Write survey analysis instructions in rmarkdown pdf
3. ~~Change to OC fonts (?)~~
4. ~~Fix long-term averages (some or all might use all years; should be all except current year)~~
5. ~~Should create new report template each year, make changes to text, then create that year's report~~

## Notes

- For whatever reason, the report will render on my Desktop but not when the project is run from the OAS drive...

- grd code: 1 = air over ground, 2 = ground, 4 = air only
